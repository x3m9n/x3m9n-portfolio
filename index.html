            <h2>Gamer and Learner</h2>
            <p>Used to play Counter Strike Global Offensive all day. I really enjoyed this part of my life. But
                situationchanges during living a life. So now here i am in Uttara in search of a stable and normal life.
                But I'llstart gaming again soon, cause someone said that don't be ashamed of your scars.</p>

            <h3>Surprise! Your savior is here!</h3>
            <p>Satisfaction isn’t in my nature.I have been falling for 30 minutes! You were made to be ruled. In the
                end, you will always kneel. It’s not that I don’t love our little talks, its just that… I don’t love
                them.</p>
